```

```
let g:tomato#show_clock = 1  
let g:tomato#show_count_down = 1 
```

## Usage

To start the Pomodoro timer and display it in the status line, run the following command in Vim:

``` 
:call tomato#start()
```

Note that the timer will continue to run even when Vim is not open, so the next time you open Vim the timer will still be running and displayed in the status line.

To stop the Pomodoro timer and remove it from the status line, run the following command in Vim:

```
:call tomato#stop()
```

To reset the Pomodoro count to 1, run the following command in Vim:

```
:call tomato#reset()
```
  
Set auto reset when number over a value
```
let g:tomato#auto_reset_num = 24 (here put the number you wanna set)  
```
if the ``` g:tomato#auto_reset_num = -1 ``` , then the auto reset will be forbidden  
if there is no ``` g:tomato#auto_reset_num``` in your config, the default ``` auto_reset_num is 24 * 60 / g:tomato#interval ```, the total tomato numbers of one day.


## troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using vim-airline-tomato, it may be necessary to install certain fonts:

[Airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline): The extension is based on vim-airline (like powerline, but faster and with a deeper KISS flavor)
[powerline-font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts): if you use wild char's, you may need install powerline font.

[pomicons](https://github.com/gabrielelana/pomicons): This is a font with 8 symbols to talk about the "Pomodoro Technique"¬Æ (You can use these special symbols to change the configuration). You can use one of the [awesome-terminal-fonts](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts) that contains both powerline and pomicons symbols.
